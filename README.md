### <p align="center">ðŸ¤– Osussist ðŸ¤–</p>

<p align="center" >
  Before you read anything else, If you are looking for the <strong>FULL IN DEPTH</strong> explanation on how it works check out my <a href="https://youtube.com/@takkeshi_dev">channel</a> in which Ill try to upload the in depth explanation of most of my scripts!
  <br><br>
  Osussist is a tool that provides real-time aim assistance for the rhythm game osu. It is fully undetectable by the osu anti-cheat and open source, so you can see how it works and even make it better if you want.

### <p align="center">ðŸ§¬ Installation ðŸ§¬</p>

<p align="center">
  Install Node: If you don't have Node installed, download and install it from the official Node website (https://nodejs.org).
  <br><br>
  Install required libraries: The script relies on several external libraries. You can install them using npm, the Node Package Manager. Open a terminal or command prompt and run the following command:
</p>

```node
npm install 
```

<p align="center">
  This will install the necessary libraries for running the script.
</p>

### <p align="center">â›‘ How it works â›‘</p>
<p align="center">
    1. The script initializes a Minecraft bot using the Mineflayer library and loads essential plugins for PvP and pathfinding.
    <br><br>
    2. It listens for user input, including commands like "!follow," "!minefor," "!defend," and more, issued by the bot owner in the Minecraft chat.
    <br><br>
    3. When the owner issues commands, the bot carries out corresponding actions, such as following the owner, mining specific blocks, defending against nearby entities, and more.
    <br><br>
    4. The bot provides status updates when requested, including health, food, armor, and experience points.

 - Once you have the skin you need to drag it into the osu window and it should install and equip it!
