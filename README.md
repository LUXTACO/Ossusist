  <br><br>
  Osussist is a tool that provides real-time aim assistance for the rhythm game osu. It is fully undetectable by the osu anti-cheat and open source, so you can see how it works and even make it better if you want.

 - Once you have the skin you need to drag it into the osu window and it should install and equip it!
